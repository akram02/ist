GENERAL INFORMATION, RULES AND REGULATIONS FOR
UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMME IN
ELECTRONICS AND COMMUNICATION ENGINEERING
Session: 2019-2020
1. Introduction:
National University pursues a policy of continuous updating and improving the four-year course
curriculum having
8 (eight) semesters and carrying
144 credits for bachelor`s degree in
Electronics and Communication Engineering (B. Sc). This is to take into account the modern
developments in the field of Electronics and Communication Engineering, where ideas and
concepts move too fast. Detailed syllabuses for all the courses have been framed keeping in view
the objective of National University in this regard. Electronics and Communication Engineering
discipline is to be considered in a special way, as it has got a professional backing and a large
employer group needs the services of its graduates.
2.Admission:
Students will be admitted in the first semester, first year of Electronics and Communication
Engineering (ECE) in affiliated colleges/Institutes as per rules of the National University.
Students passing HSC in the current year or one year ago with minimum GPA 2.0 in SSC and
HSC (Science/Diploma in Engineering/Equivalent) examination and having at least “C” grade in
Physics and Mathematics can apply. Students passing General Certificate Examination (GCE) in
at least 5 subjects in “O” level and 2 in “A” level and having at least “C” grade in physics and
Mathematics can apply. A one year break of study is acceptable.
3.  Duration of Each Semester:
The duration of each will be 19 weeks whose breakdown is as follows:
Classes
15 weeks
Recess before semester final examination
2 weeks
Semester final examination (approximately)
2 weeks
Total
19 weeks
4.  Course Designation System:
Each course is designated by a three-letter code identifying the department offering it, followed
by a three-digit number having the following interpretation:
   The first digit indicates years.
   The second and third digits indicate courses.
5.  Assignment of Credits:
The assignment of credits to a theoretical course follows a different rule from that of a practical
course.
   Theoretical Courses: One lecture of 1-hour duration per week per semester is equivalent
to 1.0 credit.




   Practical Courses: One lab session of
3-hour duration per week per semester is
equivalent to 1.5 credits. 1 credit is equivalent to two hours of lab work per semester per
week.
   Project: The project work must be initiated in 7th Semester.
6. Types of courses:
In ECE, there are two types of courses: (i)Core Courses, which form the nucleus of the B. Sc.
degree program and (ii) General Education (GED) Courses, the study of which will be useful for
the students to grow as a good citizen with social values and norms. A student has to complete
the entire designated course for the award of degree.
7.  The Grading System:
The total performance of a student in a given course is based on a scheme of continuous
assessment. For theory courses, continuous assessment is made through a set of quizzes, class
evaluation, class participation, homework assignment and a semester final examination. The
assessment in laboratory/practical courses is made through observation of the student at work
during the class, viva-voce during laboratory hours and quizzes.
Each course has a certain number of credits, which describes its corresponding weight. A letter
grade with  a specified number of  grade points  is  awarded to  each course. A  student’s
performance is measured both by the number of credits completed satisfactorily and by the
weighted average of the grade points earned. A minimum grade point average (GPA) is essential
for satisfactory progress. A minimum number of credits have to be earned in order to qualify for
the degree requirements. Letter grades and corresponding grade points (as approved by the
University Grants Communication of Bangladesh) will be awarded in accordance with the
provision shown below:
Letter Grade
Grade Point
Numerical Grade

less than 40%
*Subject in which the student gets F grades shall not be counted towards credit hours
requirements and for the calculation of Grade Point Average (GPA) or Cumulative GPA
(CGPA).
8.  Examination Rules:
There will be at least two in-course examinations to be conducted by the college/Institute for
each course and marks along with the grades be submitted to the controller of examinations of
the National University before the final examination. Semester final examinations will be
conducted by the National University on a six months basis for each semester. Semester final




examination of each theoretical course will be held for 3 hours and there will be 7 questions in
which 5 questions must be answered. Each question carrying 16 marks should contain two or
more  parts
(e.g.
1(a),
1(b),
1(c),  etc.).  Two  examiners  will  evaluate  the  semester  final
examination scripts separately. If the variation of marks of the two examiners is 20% or more, a
third examiner will be appointed to re-examine the scripts. The marks will be finalized by
averaging of minimum variation two examiners.
9.  Distribution of Marks for Theoretical Courses:
Twenty percent (20%) of marks of all theoretical courses shall be allotted to two in-course
examinations each for 7.5%. The answer scripts of in-course examinations may be sent to the
Controller of Examination of the National University if required.The rest of the marks (80%) for
each theoretical course will be allotted to the semester final examination, which will be
conducted centrally by the National University. There are internal and external examiners for
each course in the Semester final examination.
Distribution of marks for a given theoretical course is as follows:
In the case of in-course assessment 5% marks out of the allocated 20% will be awarded on the
basis of attendance as follows:
90% and above
5%
85% to less than 90%
4%
80% to less than 85%
3%
75% to less than 80%

10.  Distribution of Marks for Practical Courses:
The Practical semester final examinations have to be conducted by internal and external
examiners. The practical final examination that is conducted centrally by the National University
will be held on 60 marks for each course. Marks distribution of each practical course is stated
below:

as follows:
a.  Project Defense
50% Marks
b.  Project Report
50% Marks
A panel of examiners appointed by the National University will conduct the project defense and
also examine the project report. The project evaluation can be conducted by one or more centers,
selected by the National University. At least two members for the panel of examiners must be
present for project defense and evaluation.
12.  Calculation of GPA and CGPA:
Grade point average (GPA) is the weighted average of the points obtained in all the courses
passed/completed by a student. For example, if a student passes/completes courses in a semester
having  credits  of  C1,  C2,…………Cn  and  his/her  grade  points  in  these  courses  are  G1,
G2,………..Gn respectively, then
n

The cumulative Grade point average (CGPA) is the weighted average of GPA obtained in all the
semesters passed/completed by a student. For example, if a student passes/completes n semester
having total credits of TC1, TC2, …………TCn and his/her GPA in these semester are GPA1,
GPA2, ………..GPAn respectively, then
