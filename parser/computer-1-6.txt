To understand various aspects of MVC Framework and how it works.
1.
Introducing MVC Framework
1.1 Define MVC Framework
1.2 Discuss the features of MVC
1.3 Demonstrate MVC Architecture.
1.4 Identify Popular MVC frameworks
ASP.NET, Django, Laravel, CodeIgniter, Rails etc.
1.5 Advantages and Disadvantages of using MVC Framework.
[Instructions of instructor: As students learned the languages like Python, C#, Java
and PHP in previous semesters (3rd, 4th, 5th ) , instructor may allow various MVC
framework like ASP.NET, Django, Laravel etc.  according to student’s interest͘
ASP.NET MVC framework is demonstrated in this course as an example.  ]
2.
Explore ASP.NET MVC
[Objective of this Practice: To be familiar with MVC Pattern and basic understanding on Purpose of
Controller, Model, View and how a request is handled by ASP.NET MVC Application]
[This is an instructor driven practice, Instructor should provide a sample project and help student to
identify various component as per objective of this practice module]
2.1 Review how web works with client and server relationship and understand what is GET and
POST Request in Web application.
2.2 Demonstrate MVC Design Pattern
2.3 Identify and interpret what is Controller and what the responsibility of Controllers in
ASP.NET MVC Application is.
2.4 Identify and interpret what is Model and what the responsibility of Models in ASP.NET MVC
Application is.
2.5 Identify and interpret what View is and what the responsibility of Views in ASP.NET MVC
Application is.
2.6 Identify and interpret an overview idea of Request Life Cycle of ASP.NET MVC Application,
Get a basic idea on how a request URL is identified by ASP.NET MVC default routing and
request is redirected to a particular Controller and response occurred to client.
3.
Practice to Implement Controller
[Practice Objective: Implementing Controller and Action, to familiar with Controller and Action also
Action Parameter]
[Instructor should brief about Controller and Action (what and why) in ASP.NET MVC]
3.1 Create a Controller and output a sample string from the default Action.
For an example, create a Hello World Controller with proper naming convention and return
a string “Hello Welcome to   SP͘NET MVC” run and see from browser the output͘
3.2 Create a Controller and create an Action in that Controller and output a sample string from
that Action.




For an Example, Create a Student Controller and create an Action for Entry and return string
“Welcome to Student Entry Page” from the Entry   ction͘
3.3 Create a Controller and Create two or more Actions in that Controller and get output of
different action on the basis of URL request for that Action.
For Example, Create Action named Search and Entry in Student Controller and return string
“Welcome to Student Search” from Search   ction and “Welcome to Entry Page” from Entry
Action.
3.4 Create a Controller and Create Action with some parameters and request to the Action with
sending data from URL by query string and output the parameter data as string from Action.
For Example, On Entry Action use parameter (Name, RegNo, Address) for Entry Action,
request using query string and return string Student Name, RegNo, Address as output.
4.
Practice For Model Creating
[Practice Objective: To able to create Models and establish association relationship
between models.]
[Instructor Note: Review Object Oriented Programming C# - class, properties and
association relationship between two objects]
4.1 Create a class with at least 5 properties in Models folder.
4.2 Create a class with Properties and implement Data Annotation on Properties as per
relevance on data fields of Model.
4.3 Create two classes in Models folder and implement one to one association relationship
between those Models.
4.4 Create two classes in Models folder and implement one to many association relationship
between those Models.
For an Example. Create a Student class in Models folder with Properties (Id:int, Name:string,
RegNo:string, Address:string), use Required Data Annotation for Name and RegNo. Create a
Department class in Models Folder with Properties (Id:int, Name:string, Location:string,
Students:List<Student>) use Required Data Annotation on Name.
4.5 Create two classes in Models folder and implement one to many association relationship
between those models.
5.
Practice To Implement Controller Action Parameter and Model Binding
[Practice Objective: To able to acquire knowledge on Action and Action Parameter
binding, Requesting to a action with query string data, using action parameter data in
controller]
5.1. Create a Controller, create an Action in that Controller with Action Parameter with a Model
and request for that action from browser URL and return output of that Models property as
string.
For Example, Create a Student Controller with Entry Action with Action parameter with
Student Model, i.e. Entry (Student student) and request for Entry action with query string
and output the properties of Student models as string.




5.2 Create a Model with data annotation and use that Model as Action Parameter in a
Controller and request on that Action with query string, use Model State. Is Valid in Action
and check if Model bound properly and return output “Success” while Model State. Is Valid
true and “Failed” when Model State. Is Valid false?
5.3 Create a Controller and Action with Action parameter as List of Model and bind the model
by request URL.
For an Example, in Entry Action of Student Controller use List of Student i.e. Entry
(List<Student> students) and bind students model from request URL.
5.4 Use Bind Attribute for Model Binding in Action.
6.
Practice for Anonymous Type in C#.
[Practice Objective: To acquire clear understanding on Anonymous Type, Declaring
Anonymous typed variable, using anonymous typed variable]
[Further Application of this topic: While in ASP.NET data needed to be passed  from
HTML Helper, data is sent as anonymous type object, also for various attribute
declaration on HTML Helper anonymous type is used]
6.1 Create a C# variable with var keyword.
6.2 Create a Model class and create an instance of that model with var keyword.
For example, var student = new Student ();
6.3 Create an instance variable of an Anonymous type and output the properties of Anonymous Type. For
example, create an anonymous type with properties (Name, Price, Item Type etc) and use var keyword to
that anonymous object.
6.4 Create a instance variable of array of Anonymous typed object and use for each to traverse each
element of that array.
6.
Practice for Lambda Expression in C#
[Instructor Note: Review delegate discussed in Object Oriented in C# 4th Semester]
6.1 Declare a delegate variable using delegate type Func<>.
6.2 Declare a delegate variable using delegate type Action.
6.3 Declare a delegate of Fun<> and declare a Lambda Expression which will take a input and
return input+1.
6.4 Declare a delegate of type Func<> and declare a Lambda Expression which will take two
input and return sum result of that two input.
6.5 Declare a delegate of type Action and declare a Lambda Expression which will output a
string on Console Screen.
6.6 Declare a delegate of type Func<> and declare a Lambda Expression which will take a
instance of a class as input and output calculated data from the property of that instance.
For an Example, Func<Person, stringх fullName = (person)=хperson͘FirstName+”
”+person͘MiddleName+” ”+person͘LastName͘
7.
