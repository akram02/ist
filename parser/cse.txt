reading and writing. Special emphasis will be given to the development of  reading and writing
skills. To ensure maximum benefit from this course, 30% of  the total marks will be allotted to
class work in reading and writing.  Speaking: Students will focus on developing speaking which
will include strategies for communication and an acquaintance with phonetics. Effective oral
presentation. Tasks will include making statements, requests, inquiries, disagreeing, complaining
and apologizing, discussing, and other oral presentations. Listening: Students will practice
listening to spoken English and taking useful notes. Reading: Extracts from literary and general
essays will be used to develop comprehension as well as an understanding of  the nature of
literary communication. Students will develop the following reading strategies: Grammar in
Use: While grammar will generally be taught in context, some attention to grammar may be
necessary a this stage. The following aspects may be taught: articles, verb patterns, sentence
combining-subordination and coordination, conditional sentences, the infinitive, gerund, and
participle, subject-verb agreement. Writing: Paragraph, précis and analytical writings, writing on
current affairs, Scientific writing. Commercial Correspondences: Defining context, feedback

Objectives: Database labs are based on the theory course CSE 520208. One large or several
small database applications will be developed in the lab. Student will be given the ER model or
description of a real problem. Based on the description they will design the ER model or convert
the ER model to relational model using the features of relational database design(such as
functional dependency, normalization etc) and finalize the relational model. After finalizing the
relational model, student will go for implementation. In the implementation phases they should
design the sql statements, stored procedure, trigger, views etc. whatever is required to complete
the implementation. In the implementation phase should also be the main concern about query
optimization, transaction, recovery and backup. Any database such as Oracle/MySql/PostGress
